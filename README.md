# Predicting-term-deposit-subscription

The project aims to develop a predictive model that analyzes the customer behaviour for subscribing to term deposits.
The predictive model is trained and tested using machine learning technique of logistic regression using three softwares; R, SAS and Python.

As part of Data wrangling, imputation was performed on the dataset to deal with the missing values. Also, scaling was done since the data was highly skewed.
Further, undersampling and oversampling techniques were performed in order to overcome the imbalanced proportion of responses.

Logistic Regression was applied using R, SAS and Python and 91% accuracy was obtained on the model. In addition, coefficients of logistic regression were 
interpretted to make certain conclusions like the odds of subscribing to a term deposit for customers with university degree were approximatelt 1.5 times 
than the customers with 4-year basic education. Also, marginal effects plots were created to examine the effect of a predictor on the response.

Lastly, the outputs obtained using different softwares (R, SAS, Python) were compared.
